# Bluesky Comments for Hugo Blog

This Hugo blog now supports Bluesky comments! When you publish a blog post, you can link it to a Bluesky post and all replies to that post will appear as comments on your blog.

## How It Works

1. **You publish a blog post** on your Hugo site
2. **You share the post on Bluesky** (manually, with your own commentary)
3. **You add the Bluesky post URI** to your blog post's frontmatter
4. **Replies to your Bluesky post** automatically appear as comments on your blog

## Setting Up Comments for a Post

### Step 1: Publish Your Blog Post
Write and publish your blog post as usual. Make sure it's live on your site.

### Step 2: Share on Bluesky
Create a post on Bluesky that links to your blog post. For example:
```
Just published a new blog post about [topic]! 

[your blog post URL]

What do you think? ðŸ¤”
```

### Step 3: Get the AT URI
After posting on Bluesky, you need to get the AT URI for that post. There are several ways:

**Method 1: From the Bluesky URL**
- Your Bluesky post URL looks like: `https://bsky.app/profile/yourhandle.bsky.social/post/abc123xyz`
- Convert it to AT URI format: `at://did:plc:your-did/app.bsky.feed.post/abc123xyz`
- You'll need to find your DID (see below)

**Method 2: Use the Bluesky API**
- Visit: `https://public.api.bsky.app/xrpc/com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle?handle=yourhandle.bsky.social`
- This returns your DID
- Then construct: `at://your-did/app.bsky.feed.post/post-id`

**Method 3: Browser Developer Tools**
- Open your Bluesky post in the browser
- Open developer tools â†’ Network tab
- Look for API calls to see the AT URI in the responses

### Step 4: Add to Blog Post Frontmatter
Edit your blog post's markdown file and add the Bluesky configuration to the frontmatter:

```toml
+++
title = 'Your Post Title'
date = 2025-09-28T12:00:00-00:00
draft = false

[bluesky]
uri = "at://did:plc:your-did/app.bsky.feed.post/your-post-id"
+++
```

### Step 5: Rebuild Your Site
Run `hugo` to rebuild your static site, and the comments should appear!

## Finding Your DID

Your DID (Decentralized Identifier) is your unique identifier on the AT Protocol. To find it:

1. **API Method**: Visit `https://public.api.bsky.app/xrpc/com.atproto.identity.resolveHandle?handle=yourhandle.bsky.social`
2. **Look for**: A string that starts with `did:plc:` followed by random characters
3. **Example**: `did:plc:abc123def456ghi789jkl012`

## Example Complete AT URI

If your DID is `did:plc:abc123def456ghi789jkl012` and your post ID is `xyz789`, your AT URI would be:
```
at://did:plc:abc123def456ghi789jkl012/app.bsky.feed.post/xyz789
```

## Features

- **Nested replies** up to 5 levels deep
- **Rich content** including images, links, and quote posts
- **User avatars and profiles** 
- **Direct links** to view/reply on Bluesky
- **Responsive design** that works on mobile
- **Dark mode support**
- **No authentication required** - uses Bluesky's public API

## Disabling Comments

To disable comments on a specific post, add this to the frontmatter:
```toml
comments = false
```

## Troubleshooting

### Comments not loading?
- Check that the AT URI is correct
- Verify the Bluesky post exists and is public
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Make sure the CSS and JS files are loading

### Wrong comments showing?
- Double-check the post ID in your AT URI
- Ensure you're using the correct DID

### Styling issues?
- The CSS is in `/static/css/bluesky-comments.css`
- Customize it to match your site's design

## Technical Details

- Uses Bluesky's public API (`https://public.api.bsky.app/xrpc/app.bsky.feed.getPostThread`)
- No server-side code required
- Comments are loaded client-side with JavaScript
- Gracefully handles API failures
- Progressive enhancement - site works without JavaScript

## Workflow Summary

1. Write blog post â†’ Publish
2. Share on Bluesky â†’ Get AT URI  
3. Add URI to frontmatter â†’ Rebuild site
4. Comments appear automatically! 

The lift is minimal - just adding one line to your frontmatter after sharing each post on Bluesky.
