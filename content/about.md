## About 

!["me"](/img/me.jpg)

Portland, ME-based software person. Can juggle up to five objects. CS Masters student at Northeastern (Roux Institute). 

You can find some tutorials I made exploring images, latent space & jpg compression on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpFm-dXInX6cLwbKaXPdhzw).
I'm on [bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jakesimonds.bsky.social) and [mastodon](
https://mastodon.social/@jakejake) and other socials too. If you have a social internet thing that doesn't suck I'd love to hear about it! 

Very open to conversation/collaboration, remotely or in person here in Portland, ME. Be in touch!
