### Who am I?

I'm a software engineer < 1 year into my career. I use ChatGPT a lot, sometimes maybe too much or beyond its purposes (working at the edge of your abilities > working at the edge of ChatGPT's abilities).  

## Use-Cases I'm Not Ashamed Of

### Acronym hunting

Say I'm reading a blogpost I found on hacker news and a paragraph or sentence mentions two or three acronyms I haven't heard of. ctrl + c / ctrl + v -> ChatGPT! Since the context is already embedded in whatever I'm giving it, my anecdotal experience is that it does pretty decently defining terms (and I avoid the annoying thing of googling some obscure acronym and getting back some Realtor's Association in Nevada that shares the acronym I'm hunting for).

### 'fix the syntax'

Early in projects, when I hit a wall, I give it a few lines of code that aren't working and say 'fix the syntax'. When I'm really brave, I even go back to my broken code, and add pseudocode that I know won't work but I also know is describing exactly what I want to have happen. The more specific the better.

A while ago, I realized that this exercise was also just kind of 'rubber ducking' with the LLM, and having to explain myself to 'it,' while weird as hell, was probably kind of useful on its own anyways.

## Hot Takes

### Her?

My mental model of chatGPT is that I'm talking to the most boring person I've ever met in my life...but it just so happens that they've read every book ever written and kinda know everything?

And so when I hear people predict a coming wave of AI boyfriends and girlfriends and platonic friends and all that...I'm not buying it at the moment or in any future I can imagine iterating straightforwardly from the technology we have today. ChatGPT isn't 'Her' as in Scarlett Johannson from the 2013 movie, it's 'Her?' as in that (pretty mean) joke from *Arrested Development*. The audio quality of ChatGPT specifically is quite good. The latency when you have a conversation with it is equally impressive IMO. But there's still just zero personality there.

## Your ChatGPT conversations are not interesting to others

I, too, was riveted when Kevin Roose had that bizarre chat with Sydney/Bing and it ran in the NYTimes. But pretty much ever since that day, whenever anyone, anywhere, has told me (or worse, read to me out-loud, verbatim) about this hilarious or whatever thing chatGPT told them...I wanna tear my own eyes out. Reading something chatGPT wrote out loud is never funny, or interesting. And it's happening in the wild!

## Other hot takes for posterity
- Idea I keep coming back to when I think about/use these tools is 'blurry jpeg of the web': https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web
- A year-plus ago using chatGPT felt like being 20 minutes into an acid trip. It has not felt anything like that in a very long time, and it's honestly hard to even imagine what could move the needle in that way again, and it's super easy too to forget just how crazy all this still is.
- I love Yann Lecunn.
- If I were thinking about 'getting-into-tech' today...I think the gulf of time that I'd have to cross before I could do literally anything that chatGPT couldn't do (thinking about the year-plus of python-Turtle drawings and implementing a stack in C and tearing my hair out over just the most basic OOP concepts...) in five seconds might be a dealbreaker. It would certainly be humbling.
- A common argument against doomerism: these tools will free us all up to do the 'real work' & be 'creative' and 'inventive' because 'AI can't make new knowledge'. All reasonable points. But I worry that a lot of what we do, and a lot of what we get paid to do, is not 'creative' or 'inventive' at all. I used to act in plays and make weird comedy shows with my friends. Very LLM-resistant & not at all valued by the world. So when an LLM can write all your boilerplate, and stitch this-to-that and that-to-this, and human developers are freed up to do what the models can't do...what are you, and every other developer you know, going to do that is both 1: inventive enough that an LLM couldn't possibly have done it and 2: worth anything in this cruel & boring world?
