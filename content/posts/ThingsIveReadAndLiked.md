Lazy post, just jotting down some blog posts I've recently liked. 



# Seldo: "LLMs are good at transforming text into less text"
https://seldo.com/posts/what-ive-learned-about-writing-ai-apps-so-far

I say that line from the above blog post to myself at least a couple times a week. 

It's a justification to myself as I keep cramming text into context windows. As I ctrl+c entire pages of documentation into my cursor chat. The whole post is good but like that phrase in particular I love. 


# 'My AI Skeptic Friends Are All Nuts'

https://fly.io/blog/youre-all-nuts/

Liked this piece a lot--feels like a better version of a really common blog post I've read a number of times. 

I never feel less certain about LLMs as when I talk to engineers who are clearly way more experienced than me and way smarter than me, who are also way way way less excited about LLMs. 


# Somewhat LLM-skeptical piece I like

Short one. I don't want to do a disservice but trying to restate the points this person makes especially since the post itself is so short but I love how this post talks about just regular code.
