## Github Annotated

!["2021"](/img/2021-github.png)

### 1
I don't remember making a github account, but I'm not surprised that I did. Summer of 2021 I made a lot of accounts with various services trying to see if this 'get into tech' idea held any water. Requested the data from my sister's netflix at one point. Filled out a form to make a twitter bot. Watched some TED talks. Read a lot of marketing materials from Boot Camps. Couldn't always distinguish educational materials from technical documentation from marketing materials. 

### 2
Decided to apply to Northeastern, went to Mexico. Both good decisions. In Mexico I continued to dabble. Got a few chapters into an intro to python book but got stuck when the turtle window wouldn't stay open. No github activity.

### 3
'turtle.done()' will keep the window open so you can look at your drawing

### 4
First class using github. Also being introduced to C and Java for the first time. Github makes no sense to me. I follow instructions, typing in commands, praying, and it only rarely works, for reasons I continue to not understand. A miserable time. 

### 5 
Taking Algorithms course. Mostly math so I'm really not touching any code.

### 6
Class starts. Trying to think if Tuesday was a day things were due. I think it was. 

### 7 
Final project. We used github to all contribute to same project. First time using it like that. A few hiccups along the way. Lived those weeks in fear of merge conflicts, but looking back it mostly all worked out I think? 

### 8 
Starting to notice blank periods in my github calendar when they show up. Developing envy/confusion towards people with just a wall of green. 

### 9 
Tried to write 'HI'.

### 10 
All the submodules for this stupid website. Lots of pulling and pushing and initing and deiniting.
