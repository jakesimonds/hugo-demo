(This is literally a week of journal entries, which I fed to an LLM and told to transform/translate into something without specifics that I could post on my blog as a personal update. Then a half-dozen or so iterations of telling it to not include things, or changes in tone, then finally I literally edited a few places, and that's it.)


# How Is Jake Doing?

_A periodic check-in experiment_

Jake's doing well overall - navigating the usual mix of professional growth and personal projects that keeps things interesting.

## Work Life

Work's been engaging lately with some new technical territory to explore. The learning curve keeps things challenging in a good way, and there's satisfaction in tackling problems that would have seemed impossible not too long ago. Still plenty of room to grow, but that's part of what makes it interesting.

## Personal Stuff

He's been having FOMO seeing the creative projects of old friends on social media--excited to see people having success, but also with that feeling sad/nostalgic for a time when he felt more plugged into the creative world. 

Making progress on some personal habits and routines - nothing dramatic, but the kind of steady improvements that actually stick. Currently working through _The Power Broker_, getting back into regular exercise that's more sustainable than previous attempts, and learning drums which has been surprisingly enjoyable.

## Current Projects

Beyond work, he's been tinkering with some side interests and thinking about ways to be more intentional about social connections. Always a few ideas percolating about creative projects or ways to engage with the broader tech community.

## The Vibe Check

Things feel pretty dynamic right now - lots of different threads to pull on both professionally and personally. There's a good energy around learning new things and making connections, with that satisfying sense of building momentum on various fronts.

Generally in a phase of saying yes to interesting opportunities and seeing where they lead.
