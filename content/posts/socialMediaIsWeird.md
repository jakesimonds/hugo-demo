Someday when I have more time I want to use what I learned in computer school to make something about social media. 

I don't have the time right now. This is an attempt I made to make just a map of the social scenes I consider myself a part of and where they live digitally:

## things I would write about

(not writing about them now, just trying to put this out in the world almost to remind myself in the future that I was thinking about all this)

- breakdown the LAMP stack & what it meant to facebook back in the day for less technical audience
- when people say 'the algorithm' ... what do they mean? 
- profile people who have had interesting things happen to them on social media (& what has it meant to 'go viral' at different times as the platforms change)
