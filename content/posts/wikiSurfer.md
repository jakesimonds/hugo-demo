# WikiSurfer

![WikiSurfer with DevTools](/img/wikisurfer_devtools.png)

[WikiSurfer](https://wikisurfer.latenthomer.com) is an LLM sideproject where: 
- you're not looking at or reading slop
- model (gpt4.1-nano) is small, dumb, cheap, energy-effiecient
- navigation keys let you surf in the direction of adjectives (so your keypress of 'cat-like' means: model picks the most cat-like link on the page)

## why'd you make this? 

I made this because:
- gpt4.1-nano is just amazing and I wanted to build something that wouldn't be possible without it
- I'm very curious what LLM interfaces are gonna turn into. We can't keep chatting forever. 

## A new level of laziness unlocked Vibe-coding this

For this project, in a first for me I did the UI flow by just taking screenshots and giving them back to the model over and over again. This is example of that. 

## Wikipedia is incredible

One fun thing about this project was using it to explore wikipedia. IMO the Borders guy should have a more substantial page!
