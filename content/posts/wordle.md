!["99 percent"](/img/ninetyNineWordle.png)

Did you know that the 'Percentage' on your wordle stats is simply the number you've done successfully, over the total number of attempts rounded to the nearest integer? So 198/199 = 99.4975ish, rounds down to 99. 

!["100 percent"](/img/oneHundredWordle.png)

While 199/200 = 99.5, rounds up to 100. 

I feel obligated to add: chasing this curiousity I cheated many times, by opening up a new browser and then continuing to guess until I knew I had the right word. Those two instances of getting it on the first guess were real, though. 'Earth' and 'Piano' (which are both semi-regular starting words, which I was delighted to have tried on the days that they were that day's word).
