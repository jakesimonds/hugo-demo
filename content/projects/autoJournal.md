Mostly just giving myself practice writing scripts, trying to automate straightforward & somewhat tedious tasks. 

Was an opportunity to try a little bash (first time), also incorporated an API call to a weather service and another script that queries the local public library for when new books I'm interested in might drop (not sure how well that'll work yet--grabbed those upcoming book titles for testing purposes).

One kinda nice thing about journalling in a text document vs the cloud: a little harder (though still very possible) to get distracted since you're not directly in the browser.
